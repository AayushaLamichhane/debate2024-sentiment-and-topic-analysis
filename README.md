## Description
This project focuses on analyzing the linguistic tone and thematic content of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Debate. The tasks include:

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluated positive and negative sentiment using Bing and NRC lexicons.  
- **Emotion Analysis**: Measured emotions such as trust, anger, and joy for each candidate.  
- **Topic Modeling**: Identified the top 5 themes using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).  
- **Word Frequency**: Generated word clouds and frequency charts for comparative analysis.

## Prerequisites
To run the code, ensure you have the following:

1. **R** and **RStudio**: Installed on your system.  
2. **Libraries**: Install the required R packages:  
   ```r
   install.packages(c("tidytext", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "syuzhet", "topicmodels", "wordcloud", "tm", "tidyr"))


## Running the Code

1. Clone the Repository:
```
  git clone https://github.com/username/debate-analysis.git
  cd debate-analysis
```
2. Load the Script: Open sentiment_and_topic_analysis.R in RStudio.
3. Run the Code: Execute the script line by line or as a whole. The script performs the following tasks:
  - Reads and preprocesses the debate transcript.
  - Generates sentiment scores, emotion distributions, and word frequency plots.
  - Implements topic modeling and visualizes the results.

## Data Sources
- **Debate Transcript**: Provided in `debate_transcript.txt`.
- **Sentiment Lexicons**:
